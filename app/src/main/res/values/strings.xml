    <string name="CoffeBigText">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries
        \nfrom certain Coffea species. All fruit must be further processed from a raw material—the fruit and
        \nseed—into a stable, raw product; un-roasted, green coffee. To process the berries, the seed is
        \nseparated from the fruit to produce green coffee. Green coffee is then roasted, a process which
        transforms the raw product (green coffee) into a consumable product (roasted coffee).
        \nRoasted coffee is ground into a powder and mixed with water to produce a cup of coffee.
        \n\nCoffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
        \nprimarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and
        \ncan be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or
        \nalready-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
        \nSugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste.
        \nIt may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts.
        \nA commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop
        \n(not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).</string>
